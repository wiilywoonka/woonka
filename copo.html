	View source is a feature, not a bug. Thanks for your curiosity and
	interest in participating!

	Here are the submission guidelines for the new and improved csszengarden.com

	- CSS3 Of course! Prefix for ALL browsers where necessary.
	- go responsive; test your layout at multiple screen sizes.
	- your browser testing baseline IE9+, recent ChromeFirefoxSafari, and iOSAndroid
	- Graceful degradation is acceptable, and in fact highly encouraged.
	- use classes for styling. Don't use ids.
	- web fonts are cool, just make sure you have a license to share the files. Hosted 
	  services that are applied via the CSS file (ie. Google Fonts) will work fine, but
	  most that require custom HTML won't. TypeKit is supported, see the readme on this
	  page for usage instructions httpsgithub.commezzobluecsszengarden.com

	And a few tips on building your CSS file

	- use first-child, last-child and nth-child to get at non-classed elements
	- use before and after to create pseudo-elements for extra styling
	- use multiple background images to apply as many as you need to any element
	- use the Kellum Method for image replacement, if still needed. httpgoo.glGXxdI
	- don't rely on the extra divs at the bottom. Use before and after instead.

			pLittering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible abbr title=Document Object ModelDOMabbrs, broken abbr title=Cascading Style SheetsCSSabbr support, and abandoned browsers.p
			pWe must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the abbr title=World Wide Web ConsortiumW3Cabbr, abbr title=Web Standards ProjectWaSPabbr, and the major browser creators.p
			pThe CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one with the web.p

			h3So What is This Abouth3
			pThere is a continuing need to show the power of abbr title=Cascading Style SheetsCSSabbr. The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into this very page. The abbr title=HyperText Markup LanguageHTMLabbr remains the same, the only thing that has changed is the external abbr title=Cascading Style SheetsCSSabbr file. Yes, really.p
			pabbr title=Cascading Style SheetsCSSabbr allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.p

		div class=participation id=zen-participation role=article
			h3Participationh3
			pStrong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this page, so strong abbr title=Cascading Style SheetsCSSabbr skills are necessary too, but the example files are commented well enough that even abbr title=Cascading Style SheetsCSSabbr novices can use them as starting points. Please see the a href=httpwww.mezzoblue.comzengardenresources title=A listing of CSS-related resourcesabbr title=Cascading Style SheetsCSSabbr Resource Guidea for advanced tutorials and tips on working with abbr title=Cascading Style SheetsCSSabbr.p
			pYou may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the abbr title=HyperText Markup LanguageHTMLabbr. This may seem daunting at first if you&#8217;ve never worked this way before, but follow the listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as a guide.p
			pDownload the sample a href=examplesindex title=This page's source HTML code, not to be modified.HTMLa and a href=examplesstyle.css title=This page's sample CSS, the file you may modify.CSSa to work on a copy locally. Once you have completed your masterpiece (and please, don&#8217;t submit half-finished work) upload your abbr title=Cascading Style SheetsCSSabbr file to a web server under your control. a href=httpwww.mezzoblue.comzengardensubmit title=Use the contact form to send us your CSS fileSend us a linka to an archive of that file and all associated assets, and if we choose to use it we will download it and place it on our server.p

			pWhy participate For recognition, inspiration, and a resource we can all refer to showing people how amazing abbr title=Cascading Style SheetsCSSabbr really can be. This site serves as equal parts inspiration for those working on the web today, learning tool for those who will be tomorrow, and gallery of future techniques we can all look forward to.p

		div class=requirements id=zen-requirements role=article
			h3Requirementsh3
			pWhere possible, we would like to see mostly abbr title=Cascading Style Sheets, levels 1 and 2CSS 1 &amp; 2abbr usage. abbr title=Cascading Style Sheets, levels 3 and 4CSS 3 &amp; 4abbr should be limited to widely-supported elements only, or strong fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about functional, practical abbr title=Cascading Style SheetsCSSabbr and not the latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only real requirement we have is that your abbr title=Cascading Style SheetsCSSabbr validates.p
			pLuckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented abbr title=Cascading Style SheetsCSSabbr by now. When sticking to the guidelines you should see fairly consistent results across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number of user agents on the web these days &#8212; especially when you factor in mobile &#8212; pixel-perfect layouts may not be possible across every platform. That&#8217;s okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your design should work in at least IE9+ and the latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by over 90% of the population).p
			pWe ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. Please keep objectionable material to a minimum, and try to incorporate unique and interesting visual themes to your work. We&#8217;re well past the point of needing another garden-related design.p
			pThis is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain full copyright on your graphics (with limited exceptions, see a href=httpwww.mezzoblue.comzengardensubmitguidelinessubmission guidelinesa), but we ask you release your abbr title=Cascading Style SheetsCSSabbr under a Creative Commons license identical to the a href=httpcreativecommons.orglicensesby-nc-sa3.0 title=View the Zen Garden's license information.one on this sitea so that others may learn from your work.p
